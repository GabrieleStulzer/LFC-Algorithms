# Automata

## Algorithms

### Thompson Construction
This algorithm is used to create an NFA from a regulare expression.
It uses basic transitions to build more complex ones. Every basic transition has a start and and an end symbol.

Basic transitions:
- Derivation
- AND | OR
- Keleen Star


### Automata Simulation

### NFA-DFA Conversion
Use of the epsilon closure to eliminate useless states and redundancy.

### DFA Minimization
Use of the epsilon closure to eliminate useless states and redundancy.

### Pumping lemma for regular languages
